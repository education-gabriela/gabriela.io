Last time I went to LaraconEU as in 2014 as speaker in the community track, it was my first international event ever speaking in english and I had jitters from it.

A lot a friends were made and it was nice to see all of them again this year.

What I also like about LaraconEU it is a Laravel conference that doesn’t talk always about Laravel, being a bit less insular than one would imagine.

[Shawn McCool](http://shawnmc.cool/) and his team made a great job this year and I was very honoured this year to be in the Track #1 (Blue Track).

The first round of applauses when I was introducing myself and saying this was my second Laracon made very much emotional and triggered something on my mind:
>These people are there to soak in the knowledge you have to share, so give your best, and I confess I tried exactly that.

The venue was amazing, I don’t have a single complaint to make regarding the staff and the organisers, they made everything possible to make people comfortable and I could see them working hard behind the scenes.

The problem is when you are speaking on the second day on a 2 day conference is that you don’t get to get the most out of the other talks that are before yours: insecurity, anxiety, fear, all play a role in there.

The talks I saw were really well delivered and you could see by people that “knew their shit” as we were joking around. Also a lot of cheese jokes to break the ice.

My only regret is not have seen more of the speakers talk, which I will definitely rectify it as soon as the videos comes out, and have made new friends this years was also awesome, keep in touch!
