An year ago I was landing on Schipol airport in Amsterdam to give my first international talk. I didn't know anyone at the time and had decided a couple months before to integrate more in the community and be more vocal about diversity in tech.

There I met wonderful people, since I was not known, to be honest I am still not, I was very intimidated into talking to them, and lots of big names from the PHP community were there. [Kayla Daniels](http://www.twitter.com/kayladnls) definitely broke the shell that surrounded me and helped to be friends with other people like: [Frank de Jonge](http://www.twitter.com/frankdejonge), [Scott Wilcox](http://www.twitter.com/ssx), [Michelle Sanvers](http://www.twitter.com/michellesanvers), [Igor Wiedler](http://www.twitter.com/igorwhilefalse). And many, many other people that slowly I grew on them and them on me.

For too long I was without friends, I am still failing at it though, it is an exchange you listen to people, people listen to you, you tell about your worries and ask for advice and more often than not you may find yourself giving advice to people, and at some point of a friendship those advices stop being requested and you just know you must give them. People get lost and I do too, because, seriously, who in their right mind would want to listen to my shitty ideas?

To some extent I can say that experience was for me a religious equivalent of founding _God_ (I am a not believer, I respect all religious beliefs). Such journey of selfknowledge caused a chain reaction. I am not going to dwell on details of my private life right now, not that I am reserved person, I am not, but who is close enough to me knows.

It wasn't an easy year, I think it wasn't for nobody from what I can remember, and I _can't_ imagine how I would be after this emotional roller coaster without the support I received. Other people also helped, and they weren't there, they were people I got close after because of other conferences or common friends. For instance [Margaret Staples](http://www.twitter.com/deadlugosi), I think she is one of the people I owe an apology the most, she is always available to talk and I feel I am not being a good friend enough to her. So, Margaret, I am sorry, I am improving it, I promise you. By the way, thanks for the elePHPants < and thank you [Davey Shafik](http://www.twitter.com/dshafik) for mailing them :D.

Another person I can't thank enough is **Kayla**, she reminded me of what a friendship is and how important that is. As for **Igor**
, I love bullshitting with you, we are good on that, but he is the one who shows me how integrity should be, and is the one that makes me have faith in humanity again.

The message I want to pass is: be aware of your actions, we are impacting people, wether you like it or not you may be the role model for someone, and be open to changes, change is good, we learn a lot from it, mostly from ourselves.
