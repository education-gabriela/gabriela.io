<h3>Abstract</h3>
Many projects have been in place to increase the numbers of female workers in the IT industry. Through diversity reports we can see that the real cenario is not pretty, most IT companies have less than 20% of women technical jobs.

So, why it is important to increase these numbers? And why are they so low? In this talk I will show how teams with women gain with the diversity.

<h3>Extra information</h3>
This talk is not about competition between genders, it is how combined efforts can improve a team. All data here come from scientific studies and companies diversity reports.
