<Description>

Many projects have been in place to increase the numbers of female workers in the IT industry. Through diversity reports we can see that the real scenario is not pretty, most IT companies have less than 20% of women technical jobs. So, why it is important to increase these numbers? And why are they so low? In this talk I will show how teams with women gain with the diversity.

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Through the past years is being noticeable the interest of our industry in increasing the diversity as whole. People are getting more conscious of the importance of having a balanced team and how it is beneficial to be so.

This talk is not about gender war, of how one gender is better than another. Is about how having that balance the productivity and innovation can increase to make it a sucessful team.
